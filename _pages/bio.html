Prior to joining MSR, he received both a Ph.D. and M.Tech. (Research) Degree from the Department of Cyber Physical Systems at the Indian Institute of Science in 2023, and a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore in 2017. During his Ph.D., he worked on generative machine learning for images and developed strong theoretical foundations for the widely popular generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion model frameworks with significant contributions to high-dimensional interpolation, Fourier approximations, and partial differential equations in very large dimensional space. His doctoral research was awarded the IUPRAI Doctoral Dissertation Award 2023, and the Prof. Satish Dhawan Research Award 2024. He has received various accolades in the past, including the IEI Young Engineers’ Award 2024-25, the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems Fellowship in 2020 and 2021, and the Microsoft Research Fellowship in 2018. He also has several high-profile publications at NeurIPS, JMLR, CVPR, KDD and ICASSP. He currently works at the intersection of generative modeling and large-scale�information retrieval�models. His research interests lie broadly in the space of signal processing, image processing, information retrieval,�and generative machine learning, with a focus on building mathematically well-founded generative learning frameworks.</p> <h2 style="text-align: center;">Images for Public Articles</h2> <style>.image-row{display:flex;gap:10px;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:center}.image-row img{flex:1 1 auto;max-width:30%;height:auto;display:block}@media(max-width:600px){.image-row img{max-width:80%;margin:0 auto}}</style> <div class="image-row"> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Sample Image 1"> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Sample Image 2"> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Sample Image 3"> </div> </body></html>
