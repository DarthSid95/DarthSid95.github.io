The image shows a gibbon with a gentle expression, cradling a baby in its arms. Both are positioned behind the diamond-shaped links of a chain-link fence, which partially obscures them from view. The adult gibbon has a soft grey and white fur that contrasts sharply with the dark color of the metal fence. The infant is nestled closely to the adult, suggesting a sense of nurturing and protection. The fur of both gibbons looks plush, and the delicate facial features of the adult, especially around the eyes, are expressive and poignant. The scene is both touching and saddening, as it highlights the bond between parent and child while also drawing attention to their captivity.
