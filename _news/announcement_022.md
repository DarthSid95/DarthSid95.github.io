My Ph.D. Thesis was awarded the <b>IUPRAI Doctoral Dissertation Award 23</b> in the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning discipline. The award consists of a Certificate which was presented at the [Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP)](https://web.archive.org/web/20241224180341/https%3A%2F%2Ficvgip.in%2F) at IIITB from 13th to 15th December, 2024. A big shout out to [Chandra Sir](https://sites.google.com/view/spectrumlabeeiisc/spectrum-lab?authuser=0) for receiving the certificate on my behalf (I was at [NeurIPS 2024](https://www.siddarthasokan.com/news/announcement_020/) during the award ceremony!)
